# Hostel-Leave-Android-App

#Problem Definition
Since our hostel had the rule of signing the leave form 2-days prior of leaving, and there was no fixed time of our warden being available at hostel, it became hard to leave the hostel in case of any emergency. Hence, this application was designed to overcome the shortcomings of the inflexible rule.

This application works in two parts:
•	Part 1: This is for students, who can submit request(only one at a time) and check their leave status, whether accepted or not.
•	Part 2: This is for the warden, who can reject or accept multiple requests at a time. ( for this, install  Warden App repository)
